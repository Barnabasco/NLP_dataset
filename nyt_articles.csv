A CRISIS IN ENERGY OF WOOD,"  Time and energy are running out for more than two-thirds of the planet's population. There is a spreading energy crisis affecting billions of people that has almost nothing to do with petroleum. Still in the shadow of its unyielding opposition to United Nations restrictions on the marketing of infant formula, the United States is again poised to veto desperately needed solutions.   This energy crisis is fueled by the rampant exploitation of forests for fuel in developing countries. For the majority of the world's population -overwhelmingly rural and poor -wood is the sole energy resource for heating, cooking and cottage industries. Under intense pressure from exploding populations and commercial use, inefficiently used and not replanted, tropical forests in developing countries are receding toward extinction, leaving starvation and economic collapse in their wakes."

The move radically refocused Americans' ideas about energy, and a nationwide flurry of activity translated into money and jobs aimed at developing more and greater sources of domestic energy, be it oil, coal, hydroelectric power, or the ''futuristic'' sources like solar, wind and nuclear energy.   Ten years later the boom in the energy industry has quieted to an efficient hum. Attention has been diverted to other problems as the price of crude oil has fallen and the economy moves into and out of recessions. As a result, some experts feel that the drive to develop American energy resources is suffering from procrastination."

THE TRANSITION: Energy Policy; CLINTON TO REVAMP ENERGY DEPT. ROLE,"  President-elect Bill Clinton is prepared to give the Department of Energy a dominant role in his efforts to marry the goals of creating jobs, making industry more efficient and reducing environmental damage, transition advisers say.   Those working on the plans say they reflect Mr. Clinton's desire to transform a bureaucracy largely ignored for most of the Reagan-Bush years into an aggressive player in integrating environmental goals into economic policy."

An Energy Prophet Who Guessed Right,"  In a way, S. David Freeman is a prophet coming into his own. As head of the Ford Foundation's energy project in the early 1970's, he correctly predicted that improved energy efficiency would be cheaper than continued expansion of power plants, and he predicted that American energy use, then galloping ahead, would reach a plateau by the late 1980's. At the time, oil companies and utilities said his idea was radical and wrong, but in fact it was not radical enough. When the plateau was reached, it was 15 percent lower than what Mr. Freeman had predicted.   For the last two years Mr. Freeman has been general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), which is scrambling to replace the power from the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, which the voters closed three years ago. But Mr. Freeman is still a radical prophet. And in an interview earlier this month, he backs new technologies for electricity production to replace nuclear power."

In the past, production and consumption of those fuels contributed to economic growth. Today, we spend $40 billion a year on imported oil, another $50 billion to protect the Persian Gulf sea lanes and billions more to clean up the pollution from oil, coal and nuclear power."

THE THREAT TO WIND ENERGY,"  From a windy ridgetop here, one can look out at 5,000 spinning wind turbines, where four years ago there were only cattle and rolling hills. But the rapid growth of wind-produced energy here and elsewhere has been as much a response to generous Federal and California tax credits as to any perceived energy crisis.   Those credits are about to expire, posing a huge threat to the fledgling wind energy business, and prompting debate on the role of tax policy in the development of new technology. To survive, wind energy developers will have to acquire new sources of capital, and generate sufficient revenues to pay their debts, something many may not be able to do."

A SCARED NEW WORLD OF THIRD WORLD ENERGY,"  For developing countries at least, there was a scrap of good news from Geneva last week. At the same time the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to increase world oil prices, it decided to freeze its basic price for a year, thus protecting poorer countries from unexpected and unmanageable increases.   But unless long range steps are taken and taken soon, even that may not be enough. Nearly 100 developing countries depend on oil to meet more than 60 percent of their energy needs. Most of them import four-fifths of their total oil requirements. The price of oil, in inflation-adjusted terms, has quintupled over the past decade, and many analysts predict price increases of 3 percent annually. This means the poor countries are spending $50 billion a year to pay for imported oil and could be paying $110 billion by 1990. Forty percent of the developing world's timber reserves may literally go up in smoke, as households and small industry substitute firewood for oil."

Researchers Develop 'Smart' Window to Cut Energy Consumption,"  IN an effort to make buildings and vehicles more energy efficient, and reduce energy consumption in the United States, researchers at Tufts University have developed a window that can regulate the amount of sunlight flowing into a building or car and the amount of heat flowing out.   The technology, known as electrochromic ""smart"" windows, uses a relatively short pulse of electrical current to vary the transparency of two thin layers of material in the windows at various optical wavelengths. In cold weather, a window could be adjusted to allow the full amount of available sunlight through to warm a room, while in hot weather it could reflect the light, preventing it from warming the room."
